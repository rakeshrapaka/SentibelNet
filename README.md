Week -1 Focus

Understand what a NIDS does and why it matters in cybersecurity.

Review the project roadmap — weekly milestones and deliverables.

Set up the development environment (folders, Python, libraries).

Explore the NSL-KDD dataset — its structure, features, and attack types.

Clarify team expectations — coding style, documentation, and review process.

The goal is to make sure we’re all technically ready and conceptually aligned before implementation begins.
