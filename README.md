SentinelNet is designed to monitor network traffic in real time and detect suspicious or malicious activity using machine learning.
It learns from past data (like NSL-KDD) to classify behavior as normal or attack and raises alerts when anomalies are detected.

In real-world enterprise networks, systems like this are how companies prevent intrusions, DDoS attacks, and data breaches — it’s the AI layer that helps security teams identify threats early.


Think of SentinelNet as the AI security camera inside a company’s network:
the firewall stops known threats, while SentinelNet intelligently spots abnormal behavior that traditional tools might miss — and sends an alert to the security dashboard.
