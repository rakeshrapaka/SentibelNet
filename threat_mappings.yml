threats:
  - id: ddos_attack
    name: "DDoS attack"
    description: "Multiple computers flood a server with requests to make it crash."
    detection_signals:
      - "High traffic volume"
      - "Sudden spike in connection requests"
      - "Large number of requests from many source IPs"
      - "Unusual protocol usage or traffic patterns"
    sentinel_detection: |
      High traffic volume and abnormal connection patterns → anomaly detection flags deviation.
    suggested_response:
      - "Throttle or block offending IP ranges"
      - "Activate rate-limiting rules on perimeter devices"
      - "Notify SOC and scale down/upstream resources"

  - id: brute_force_login
    name: "Brute-force login attack"
    description: "Repeated login attempts from the same IP address trying to guess credentials."
    detection_signals:
      - "Multiple failed login attempts within short time window"
      - "High number of authentication attempts from single IP or subnet"
      - "Unusual username targeting patterns"
    sentinel_detection: |
      Repeated failed attempts in log features → classification model detects suspicious activity.
    suggested_response:
      - "Temporarily block or throttle offending IP"
      - "Trigger MFA or account lockout policies"
      - "Alert identity/Access team for investigation"

  - id: port_scanning
    name: "Port scanning"
    description: "Attacker scans ports to discover open services on hosts."
    detection_signals:
      - "High number of connection attempts to many ports on a host"
      - "Short-duration connections with no payload"
      - "Sequential port access patterns from same source"
    sentinel_detection: |
      Abnormal number of connection attempts to different ports → detected as 'suspicious pattern'.
    suggested_response:
      - "Block or rate-limit scanner IPs"
      - "Harden exposed services and close unused ports"
      - "Log and escalate to SOC for follow-up"

  - id: data_exfiltration
    name: "Data exfiltration"
    description: "Sensitive data being transferred out of the network to unauthorized destinations."
    detection_signals:
      - "Unusually large outbound data transfers"
      - "Outbound connections to unfamiliar or blacklisted destinations"
      - "Use of non-standard ports or protocols for large transfers"
    sentinel_detection: |
      Unusual data size in outbound traffic → deviation from normal flow.
    suggested_response:
      - "Block or isolate suspicious outbound connections"
      - "Initiate data loss prevention (DLP) procedures"
      - "Alert security team and audit recently accessed data"
